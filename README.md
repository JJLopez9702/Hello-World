# Hello-World
My very first repository in GitHub ever!

I am 23 years old and I am an apprentice electrician that got electrocuted with 277v four month ago and decided to change
careers to a less dangerous job.
I started coding less than a month ago and I am loving it.
I think I will persue this as a full time job in the near future as soon as I learn more HTML & CSS.
My end-game is to own a Multi-Media Advertising Agency because film and photography are my #1 passion.
